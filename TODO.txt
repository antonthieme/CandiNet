METRICS
Look up 'information retrieval' metrics: https://www.pinecone.io/learn/offline-evaluation/
- e.g. clustering (cluster in shared embedding space and look at within cluster heterogeneity etc. to see if the proteins/go terms that are known to be related do still cluster together)
- e.g. multilabel (how many similar ones do you have to retrieve to have all correct labels show up at least once)

RIGOR
- make sure that train/val/test datasets do not share homologous groups or closely related go terms

COOL STUFF
- train decoders, get ESM embeddings of functional & nonfunctional variants of proteins, check if annotation changes
